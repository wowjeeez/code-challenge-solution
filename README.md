# code-challenge-solution
My solution for the Rust challenge at [company]
- I relied on the compiler, and manual tests, and chose a mutable reference approach, with layered abstractions.
- I didn't go with Serde for SER/DESER because I found manual parsing easier.
- The code compiles with 0 warnings and errors.
